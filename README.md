- The exercise took me at around 5 hours to complete, even tho there are things that I had to left behind.

- I don’t consider the exercise to be hard, but in fact, time consuming. 
Having to work on the camera took me a lot of time because I wanted it to follow the path, adding a normalized rotation that 
would follow from start to end along the path. At the end I had to scrap the idea and go for an easier implementation.

-The pathing has been done using Bezier curves, but since I only know the basic behavior of it, I wasn’t able to do a full pathing 
in the time I had, so at the end I had to split the full path into mini-paths. With more time I could have done it better and add 
mesh creation along the path.

I also ran out of time, so at the end I was only able to implement a single obstacle which I rotated so it could fill every gap of the map.
There are of course a lot of user experience things I left behind; player getting hit feedback, 
% of the map completed on the top side of the screen, better UI because right now it’s a single button with a text, ending feedback…

- I find the game quite complete and fun, and to be honest, I haven’t thought on what could be 
implemented more since I have only played at around 10 levels to see how the chore mechanic of the game works and the 
different levels that are on it.

- I found the exercise quite interesting, and even tho I couldn’t finish everything I had on mind at the begging I’m quite 
happy with the result (at least I finished the main gameplay loop).
